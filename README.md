Running the tests
-----------------
I've choosed [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) for my test framework and [expect.js](http://https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js) for assertions.

Install both modules:

	npm install â€“g mocha 
  npm install -g expect.js

Run the tests:

	mocha

You should type mocha from the mus directory.
